# ShortFormGenerator
Generates short form videos (1080x1920) using content from TikTok. 
**Please do not post the generated content anywhere, as it belongs to it's original TikTok creator**.

I created this program for fun, and to learn new skills such as movie.py and working with downloading files from the internet.

# How it works
1. Selects a random topic from the list of topics the user creates
2. Searches for videos with the topic as a hashtag on TikTok
3. Selects a random video with that hashtag
4. Uses a 3rd party API to download the video without a watermark
5. Combines the TikTok video, a secondary video, and a background together into one video
6. Saves the result into the outputs folder
7. Repeats indefinitely until the user ends the program
